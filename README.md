## Advanced Lane Finding

The goal of this project is to create a software pipeline to identify lane boundaries in a video by:
1. Computing camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients
2. Applying a distortion correction to images.
3. Using color transforms, gradients, etc to create a thresholded binary image
4. Apply a perspective transform to rectify the image and obtain a birds-eye view
5. TODO - Detect lane pixels to determine the lane boundary
6. TODO - Determine the curvature of the boundary
7. TODO - Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image
8. TODO - Display the lane boundaries and an estimation of curvature on the video.

This is the 4th project in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.
